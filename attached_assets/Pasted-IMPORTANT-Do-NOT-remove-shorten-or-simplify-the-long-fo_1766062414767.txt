IMPORTANT:
Do NOT remove, shorten, or simplify the long-form reasoning text ("wall of text").
Those represent the full scientific report and must remain intact.
Do NOT refactor backend, server logic, APIs, routing, or data schemas.
Do NOT add new AI calls or external services.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
The AI must NOT be overly agreeable or optimistic.
This is a scientific R&D context (drug development, translational research).
Critical reasoning, skepticism, cost awareness, and feasibility constraints are mandatory.

GOAL:
Preserve the existing deep, long-form scientific reasoning,
while adding an additional decision-support layer that highlights:
- realism
- constraints
- risks
- costs
- and feasibility

This is NOT a motivational or exploratory AI.
This is a scientific decision-support tool.

────────────────────────────
A) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (ADDITIVE ONLY)
────────────────────────────
For each reasoning step, add an "Executive Summary" card ABOVE the existing text.
The full text remains fully visible immediately below.

The Executive Summary must include:

1) Core Takeaway (2–3 bullets)
   - What can realistically be claimed
   - What CANNOT be claimed yet

2) Evidence Strength
   - Low / Medium / High
   - Short justification extracted from the text

3) Key Limitations & Failure Modes (max 5 bullets)
   - Confounding variables
   - Measurement bias
   - Population mismatch
   - Translational risk
   - Overinterpretation risk

4) Next Actions (max 5 bullets)
   - Concrete, testable, incremental steps only
   - No speculative or vague actions

Rules:
- No new AI calls
- Heuristic extraction from existing text
- Memoized parsing

────────────────────────────
B) SESSION-LEVEL DECISION SUMMARY
────────────────────────────
At the top of the session, add a persistent "Decision Summary" panel:

- Best current answer (concise, cautious)
- What is still unknown (bullets)
- Selected hypothesis (if any)
- Rejected hypotheses with explicit reasons
- Confidence level: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH (default to LOW unless clearly justified)
- Top 3 next decisions to be made

Tone must be conservative and non-promissory.

────────────────────────────
C) STUDY & EVIDENCE VALIDITY (ADDITIVE UI)
────────────────────────────
Add a "Evidence & Study Validity" section (purely UI):

Evaluate across 4 dimensions:
1) Internal validity / bias
2) External validity / generalizability
3) Measurement validity
4) Statistical robustness

For each:
- Score 0–100 (heuristic)
- Short explanation extracted from text
- Explicit disclaimer:
  "Heuristic estimate for decision support only. Not ground truth."

────────────────────────────
D) R&D FEASIBILITY, COSTS & TIMELINES (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────
Extend the R&D Roadmap presentation with a structured feasibility layer:

For each phase (Preclinical / Phase I / Phase II / Phase III):
- Estimated duration (order-of-magnitude, e.g. months/years)
- Estimated cost range (rough, conservative ranges)
- Primary failure risks
- Go / No-Go decision criteria
- Regulatory bottlenecks

Rules:
- Conservative estimates only
- If uncertainty is high, explicitly state it
- Avoid optimistic timelines or costs

This layer must emphasize:
"Most drug development programs fail."

────────────────────────────
E) UX & PRESENTATION CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────
- Long-form text must remain readable and unchanged
- Executive summaries must not hide complexity
- Use spacing and hierarchy suitable for professional research tools
- No gamification, no optimistic language
- Preserve navigation and existing functionality

────────────────────────────
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────
- List files changed
- Provide full updated code for changed files only
